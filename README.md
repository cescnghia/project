Official news: an echo of Twitter?

# Abstract

Through the years, Twitter has grown in one of principal sources of information in the United States. Providing real-time information and getting people more involved in important issues, to such an extent that they use it instead of official news. Nevertheless, news on Twitter may be incorrect and create false information on important topics. This study will evaluate the discrepancies between news on Twitter and on official newspapers. The goal is to compare the topics creating the newest trends as well as the veracity of the news on Twitter compared to the official ones and to estimate the number of false information. The evaluation will be split according to some important topics such as politics or global warming/ecology. For this purpose, two main datasets will be used: the Twitter’s one and the News on the Web. This story will highlight how Twitter became a prominent source of information and often faster than the official news.


# Research questions

- Can Twitter replace official news?

- How long does it take to correct fake news on Twitter ?

- How fast news travel on Twitter ?

- Which topics are the most retweeted and spread the fastest in time and place?

# Dataset:

- Twitter dataset
- News on the Web

Given that the Twitter dataset is huge we are going to take into account only the tweets in a certain period(for ex. one year). Same thing goes for the News on the Web dataset. We are going to use topic extraction techniques to find “the hottest” subjects. Then we will apply exploratory data analysis to get a better and deeper understanding of the data in order to be able to compare Twitter with the News on the web dataset.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Planning for the next project milestone.
- When the Twitter dataset is released, have a closer look at it.
- Reality/feasibility check
- Reduce datasets to our time period
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

# Questions for TAa

- Is a dataset of only american tweets available, if not can we extract it from the whole Twitter dataset ?
